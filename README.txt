Keep your Unraid server at your fingertips with real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, storage, and temperatures. Get instant alerts when your UPS switches to battery power, when disk temperatures spike, or when parity checks complete.

Control your Docker containers and virtual machines directly from Homey. Start, stop, and restart services without leaving your smart home app. Create powerful automations that respond to your server's health, like dimming lights when a parity check begins or sending notifications when storage is running low.
